        <u>Purpose</u>
      </h2>
    <p>
      This demonstration example introduces one of the current vector control elements of the EMD library:
      <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDPMSMTC01.html">EMDPMSMTC01</a>. 
      It is used as part of a control system of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). 
      The system takes a torque command as input while imposing voltage and current limits.

        <u>Description</u>
      </h2>
    <p>
      This model represents a 
      control system of a PMSM with three main parts:
      the control, the inverter and the motor.
      <br>
      The control elements and the motor come from the EMD library. 
      The three-phase inverter comes from the ESC library, it is used to transform the
      DC voltage into AC voltage.
      <br>
      The current vector control element (<a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDPMSMTC01.html">EMDPMSMTC01</a>) 
      defines the dq currents needed to produce a torque 
      equals to the torque command.
      Some quantities have an impact on the dq currents chosen by the control:
      the maximum phase current RMS magnitude (Imax),
      the maximum phase voltage RMS magnitude (Umax),
      and the rotor relative speed.
      <br>
      The rotor relative speed slope is plotted:

      The electric machine is a brushless permanent magnet motor commanded
      with field oriented vector control. The 
      <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDPMSMTC01.html">EMDPMSMTC01</a> 
      control submodel sets the d and q axes current objectives in response to the torque 
      command reference.
      The <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDPMSMCC01.html">EMDPMSMCC01</a>
      submodel uses two PI controllers to regulate the machine currents to these values.
      <br>
      Direct and reverse abc to dq0 transformations are realized with the 
      <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDDPT01.html">EMDDPT01</a>
      and <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDDQ02P01.html">EMDDQ02P01</a>
      submodels.
      This is necessary since the
      machine is fed in the standard abc frame.
      <br>
      Phase-line transformations are applied using the submodels
      <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDSDUP01.html">EMDSDUP01</a>,
      <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDSDI01.html">EMDSDI01</a>,
      <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDSDUSP01.html">EMDSDUSP01</a>.
      <br>
      Finally, commanded voltage values are given to the three-phase inverter
      for proper electric motor control.
      <br>
      The sketch contains a third connector for the homopolar element of dq0 transformation.
      Although the input value is not used by the control submodel, and the output is constantly set to zero.

      Machines are usually characterized by a maximum torque vs. speed curve like the
      one shown on <b>Figure 5</b>. The figure also shows the control strategy imposed
      limits, with respect to maximum stator voltage (Umax) and current (Imax) mentioned above. 
      The point where power output decreases is also shown (P&lt;Pmax). The curve shown
      represents the <b>maximum limits </b>for a given machine, but an infinite number of
      lesser torque values are contained inside of it. To see some of these values, as well
      as the maximum limit, we will do a Batch Run. 
    </p>

      <b>Figure 6: Torque vs. rotor speed (delta)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After plotting the results we see that different torque commands will give the
      desired output for a different range of speeds but will always reach a speed
      were the torque command cannot be respected. For the conditions leading to these limitations,
      you can consult the <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDPMSMTC01.html">
      EMDPMSMTC01</a> submodel documentation.

    <h3>
      Power Output
    </h3>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="12_VectorControl_fichiers/powerout.png" alt="Power vs. rotor speed"><br>
      <b>Figure 7: Power output<br>(Power vs. rotor speed characteristic)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is another characteristic curve  for a PMSM: power output versus rotor speed.
      It can be observed that, as before, the command strategy imposed limits have an effect
      on machine behavior. We can observe the Umax limit influence, shown as a border in the previous image,
      in the power output curve shown in the next image:
    </p>

      alt="Power vs. rotor speed, from simulation"><br>
      <b>Figure 8: Power output<br>(from simulation)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The curve can be explained by the control states applied on each section:
      <ul>
      <li>
      <b>State 1</b> corresponds to the fist slope, where current and voltage
      can grow freely.
      </li>
      <li>
      <b>State 2</b> represents the first limit, when Umax is reached 
      and the slope changes inclination as a result.
      </li>
      <li><b>State 3</b> represents the maximum
      power limit, that remains constant until
      </li>
      <li><b>State 5</b> is reached, where
      current is lowered to keep torque at maximum, resulting in a decreasing power output;
      although the exact state transition points depend on the machine, as defined by its parameters. 
      </li>
      </ul>
      These transitions can be appreciated in the next image:

   <h3>
      Star/Delta transformation
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      To control a motor with a star winding connection type, you must 
      change the <b>connecType</b> global parameter from delta to star.
      This will update the parameters in all three "line to phase transformations" components 
      as well as in the synchronous machine. 
      Also, to be completely equivalent to the previous system, DC voltage supply will be multiplied by
      \(\sqrt{3}\).

      The advantage of using the <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDSDUP01.html">EMDSDUP01</a>,
      <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDSDI01.html">EMDSDI01</a> and
      <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDSDUSP01.html">EMDSDUSP01</a>
      submodels is that no changes in the control strategy are required for a different type
      of winding connection of the PMSM machine.

      Finally, it is interesting to note that the <a href="../../../libesc/doc/html/submodels/ESCAVINV001.html">ESCAVINV001</a>
      average three-phase inverter submodel calculates the effects on the power supply of converter losses, but not
      their effect on the machine's regulation. Also, because it is an average model, it cannot correctly
      predict what happens when the safety margin (also known as modulation depth) is not enough to prevent
      overstepping the maximum RMS phase voltage. For this kind of simulation a more 
      complete inverter and control system is needed. This will be covered in the demo:

      Permanent magnet synchronous 
      motor vector control (advanced example)</a>.
