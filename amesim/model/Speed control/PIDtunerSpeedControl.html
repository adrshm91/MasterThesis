<h2><u>Purpose</u></h2>
 <p>This demo illustrates how to calibrate a speed control loop for an electro-mechanical system with help of the 
 <a href="qthelp://lmsimagine.lab/ame_dir/libsig/doc/html/utils/pidTuner.html">PID tuner</a></p>

<h2><u>Description</u></h2>
 <p>Let's consider a 48 V, 400 W drive system as depicted in Figure 1. The system is made of a brushless DC motor which moves a reciprocating load through a 
 reduction gear. The load is connected to the reducer shaft with a coupling device represented by its stiffness and damping. 
 The load consists of an inertia and a resistive torque proportional to speed (e.g. viscous friction). External torque 
 disturbance may also affect the load.</p>
 <p>The objective is to control the speed of the load so that it follows a mission profile made of constant acceleration and constant speed 
 sequences in the 0-300 rpm range. For this purpose, the system is equipped with a speed sensor and a varying voltage source to control the DC motor 
 (0 to +48 V).</p>

 <h3>Before closing the loop</h3>
 <p>Although this step is not required when using the PID tuner, let's quickly analyze the system we are about to control. For this, let's run a simulation 
 to compute linearization of the open-loop model and plot its Bode diagram (available in the plot configuration <i>open-loop Bode diagram</i>). One can 
 recognize a low-pass system with two resonances around 17 Hz and 206 Hz coming from mechanical and electrical dynamics.</p>

 <h3>Prepare for control synthesis</h3>
 <p>Let's close the loop using the PID controller <a href="qthelp://lmsimagine.lab/ame_dir/libsig/doc/html/submodels/SIGPIDT0.html">SIGPIDT0</a>. According 
 to the <a href="qthelp://lmsimagine.lab/ame_dir/libsig/doc/html/utils/pidTuner.html">PID tuner</a> guidelines,</p>
 <ul>
   <li>The speed target is connected to port 3, the speed sensor signal to port 1.</li> 
   <li>The output of the PID is connected to the voltage source.</li>
   <li><i>control setpoint at port 3</i> is declared as <i>control</i> and <i>plant value at port 1</i> as <i>observer</i></li>
   <li>Linearization dates are added to compute linearization at different operating speeds.</li>
   <li>The default proportional gain is scaled for this system with a starting value given by <i>kP = nominal PID output / max load speed = 30 V / 300 rpm = 
   0.1.</i></li>
 </ul>

 <p>The system can be simulated to check that the load is moving in a stable fashion.</p>

 <h3>Control synthesis, step 1</h3>
 <p>Let's open the <a href="qthelp://lmsimagine.lab/ame_dir/libsig/doc/html/utils/pidTuner.html">PID tuner</a> by clicking on its icon, 
 either from the <i>Variables</i> or from the <i>Parameters</i> view. The tool loads linear analysis data and displays the Bode diagram and the 
 step response as depicted on the left hand side of Figure 5. Let's first <b>adjust default frequency and time limits</b> to focus on the interesting 
 part of those curves (e.g. dominant modes centered in the frequency range, full transient for step response). For this, go into the <i>Options</i> 
 menu and change the frequency range of interest to 1-1000 Hz and the time scale to 0.2 s. One can recognize the diagram that was extracted previously 
 from the stand-alone open-loop model.</p>
 <p align="center"><img src="./PIDtunerSpeedControl_fichiers/changeOptions.png"></p> 
 <p align="center"><b>Figure 5: Adjusting frequency and time scales</b></p>
 <br>
 
 <p>The plant is now correctly loaded. By changing the linearization time from the corresponding combo box, it can confirmed that this 
 model is time invariant since the Bode curve doesn't change with linearization point. Therefore, we don't have to think about which one to 
 select for gain synthesis and we can move to the next step.</p>
 <br>
 
 <h3>Control synthesis, step 2</h3>
 <p>A simplified model has to be fitted on top of this linearization with the <i>Plant estimate widget</i>. Although this can be done manually by 
 selecting a model type in the list and tuning its parameters until a good match is found, let's try the <b>auto-fitting</b> feature by hitting the 
 <i>Find best estimate</i> button. The tool quickly converges to a second order model as shown in Figure 6. What matters here is to correctly capture 
 the dominant dynamic which is best represented by the step response or by the left hand side of the frequency response. Model fit is completed, so 
 we can move to the PID tuning by hitting the <i>Next</i> button</p>
 <p align="center"><img src="./PIDtunerSpeedControl_fichiers/modelFit.png"></p> 
 <p align="center"><b>Figure 6: Fitting a model</b></p>
 <br>
 
 <h3>Control synthesis, step 3</h3>
 <p>By selecting a slower or a faster response with the slider bar, the tool automatically computes the PID gains. Therefore, calibration is about 
 choosing the desired dynamic, while taking care of stability margins to deal with potential perturbations or plant variations. The tuning setup 
 can be applied to the submodel with the <i>Apply</i> button. After updating the simulation, results can be confirmed using the plot 
 configuration <i>control</i>.</p>
 <p>Let's take 2 tuning examples:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>A <b>robust</b> tuning (8 Hz, see Figure 7) which provides smooth response and acceptable perturbation rejection between t = 0.45 and 0.7 s. 
   Stability margins are rather conservative (90.9 deg and 12.1 dB).</li>
   <li>A more <b>dynamic</b> tuning (21 Hz, see Figure 8) which pushes the limit up very low gain margin (3.7 dB). The high frequency mode of the 
   system is now clearly excited with pretty poor damping. The systems performs faster but might become unstable for larger perturbations 
   due to its low margin.</li>
 </ul>

 <br>
 
 <p>In the example above, the controller doesn't reach the upper voltage limit. One can however protect the system by enabling saturation of the PID output. 
 For this, turn the <i>limit output</i> option of the PID to <i>yes</i> and set max value to 48. Default settings are recommended for saturation (e.g. <i>back calculation and tracking</i> mode with 
 <i>Ks = Ki</i>). Performance can still be fine tuned either from the slider bar or by editing gains individually (preferably in the tool to benefit from the 
 pre-visualization of their influence).</p>
