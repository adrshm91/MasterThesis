<h2><u>Purpose</u></h2>
 <p>This demo illustrates how to make a position control loop by cascading 2 PID loops and calibrating them with 
 the <a href="qthelp://lmsimagine.lab/ame_dir/libsig/doc/html/utils/pidTuner.html">PID tuner</a>. It's a continuation of the 
 <a href="qthelp://lmsimagine.lab/ame_dir/demo/Libraries/SIG/PIDtunerSpeedControl.html">speed control loop</a> demo.</p>

<h2><u>Description</u></h2>
 <p>Let's consider a 48 V, 400 W drive system as depicted in Figure 1. The system is made of a brushless DC motor which moves a reciprocating load through a 
 reduction gear. The load is connected to the reducer shaft with a coupling device represented by its stiffness and damping. 
 The load consists of an inertia and a resistive torque proportional to speed (e.g. viscous friction). External torque 
 disturbance may also affect the load.</p>
 <p>The objective is now to control the position of the load so that it follows a mission profile made of constant acceleration, constant speed 
 and constant position sequences. The speed control loop which was previously 
 designed with the PID tuner is kept and an outer position loop will be defined here, using an additional position sensor.</p>

 <h3>Prepare for control synthesis</h3>
 <p>Let's close the position loop using the PID controller <a href="qthelp://lmsimagine.lab/ame_dir/libsig/doc/html/submodels/SIGPIDT0.html">SIGPIDT0</a>. 
 According to the <a href="qthelp://lmsimagine.lab/ame_dir/libsig/doc/html/utils/pidTuner.html">PID tuner</a> guidelines,</p>
 <ul>
   <li>The position target is connected to port 3, the position sensor signal to port 1.</li> 
   <li>The output of the PID is connected to speed control PID setpoint (e.g. it's giving a speed target).</li>
   <li><i>control setpoint at port 3</i> is declared as <i>control</i> and <i>plant value at port 1</i> as <i>observer</i></li>
   <li>Linearization dates are added to compute linearization at different operating speeds.</li>
   <li>The default proportional gain is scaled for this system with a starting value given by <i>kP = nominal PID output / max position = 
   300 rpm / 90 deg = 3.33.</i></li>
 </ul>

 <p align="center"><b>Figure 2: Closed-loop model</b></p>
 <br>
  
 <p>Next, the <i>linearization behavior</i> status of the inner loop PID must be switched to <i>normal</i> so that the outer loop 
 PID sees correctly the inner loop during linearization.</p>

 <p>The system can be simulated to check that the load is moving in a stable fashion. One can observe that position tracking is already decent 
 with the proportional control, even though a bit slow.</p>

 <h3>Control synthesis, step 1</h3>
 <p>Let's open the <a href="qthelp://lmsimagine.lab/ame_dir/libsig/doc/html/utils/pidTuner.html">PID tuner</a> by clicking on its icon, 
 either from the <i>Variables</i> or from the <i>Parameters</i> view. The tool loads linear analysis data and displays the Bode diagram and the 
 step response as depicted on the left hand side of Figure 5. Let's first adjust ranges to focus on the interesting part of those curves (e.g. 
 dominant modes centered in the frequency range, full transient for step response). For this, go into the <i>Options</i> menu and change 
 the frequency range to 1-1000 Hz and the time scale to 0.1 s.</p>
 <p align="center"><img src="./PIDtunerPositionControl_fichiers/changeOptions.png"></p> 
 <p align="center"><b>Figure 5: PID tuning tool, adjusting frequency and time scales</b></p>
 <br>
 
 <p>The plant is now correctly loaded. The system behaves as an integrator at low frequencies. That's why the proportional gain is 
 already providing a zero static error. By changing the linearization time from the corresponding combo box, it can be confirmed that this 
 model is time invariant since the Bode curve doesn't change with linearization point. Therefore, we don't have to think about which one to 
 select for gain synthesis and we can move to the next step.</p> 
 <br>
 
 <h3>Control synthesis, step 2</h3>
 <p>A simplified model has to be fitted on top of this linearization with the <i>Plant estimate widget</i>. Although this can be done manually by 
 selecting a model type in the list and tuning its parameters until a good match is found, let's try the <b>auto-fitting</b> feature by hitting the 
 <i>Find best estimate</i> button. The tool quickly converges to an integrator with first order lag as shown in Figure 6. One can recognize the 
 natural frequency of the speed loop that was previously tuned at 8.0 Hz. Model fit is completed, so we can move to the PID tuning by hitting 
 the <i>Next</i> button.</p>

 <br>
 
 <h3>Control synthesis, step 3</h3>
 <p>By selecting a slower or a faster response with the slider bar, the tool automatically computes the PID gains. Therefore, calibration is about 
 choosing the desired dynamic, while taking care of stability margins to deal with potential perturbations or plant variations. The tuning setup 
 can be applied to the submodel with the <i>Apply</i> button. After updating the simulation, results can be confirmed using the plot 
 configuration <i>control</i>. In the example below, the position loop is tuned at 5 Hz to get reasonable gain and phase margins.</p>

 <p align="center"><b>Figure 7: Closed-loop response with robust tuning</b></p>
 <br>
 <p>For sake of demonstration, let's push the tuning until stability limits are just passed. This happens nearby 24.5 Hz. Around this frequency, both phase 
 and gain margins are roughly zero due to the high frequency resonance of the system. 
 After applying gains and updating the simulation, one can confirm that the system starts running stable and fast with however noisy commands. Along with time and 
 excitation from perturbations, the magnitude of oscillations at PID output is increasing. This unstable behavior gets worse and worse and is 
 eventually making the system diverge. Let's note that this instability is caused by the high frequency mode of the system around 250 Hz which mostly comes from
 the DC motor dynamics. This can be visualized with the <i>Stability plot</i> available under the <i>More plots</i> menu.</p>

 <p>This example highlights the necessity of checking stability margins with the PID tuner when calibrating the dynamic response.</p>
 <br>
 <p>As a conclusion, we've seen in this demo how PID controllers can be cascaded to isolate dynamics and how they can be easily calibrated 
 thanks to the PID tuner.</p>
