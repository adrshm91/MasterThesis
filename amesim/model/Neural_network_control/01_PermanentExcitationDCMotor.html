      <u>Purpose</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This demonstration aims at giving an example that helps the designer in 
      selecting the appropriate DC motor for a specific application.
    </p>
    <p>
      A standard set of curves, used to select the right motor, are plotted. The setting
      of sketch parameters is also explained.

    <h3>
      <u>Model description</u>
    </h3>
    <p>
      In order to plot a DC motor's characteristic curves, one has to represent
      the DC motor's mechanical and electrical behavior:
      It is assumed the DC motor is not a perfect one, so an inertia model
      with both viscous and stiction friction is added to the direct current machine model.

    <h3>
      <u>Performance Curve</u>
    </h3>
    <p>           
      A machine's  performance curve is typically a group of curves on the
      same diagram and they are typically represented with respect to
      mechanical torque:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The efficiency of the motor
      </li>
      <li>The mechanical speed
      </li>
      <li>The current consumed
      </li>
      <li>The mechanical power produced by the motor.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2: Performance Curve for DC Motor</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that these curves depend on the supply voltage level (retrieved
      from the DC motor supplier data sheets) and are given for a single temperature.
      Moreover, one should consider the temperature effect on the machine's
      characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step of the process is to retrieve the value for the electrical 
      and mechanical parameters of the motor:
    </p>
    <p align="center">

      "./01_PermanentExcitationDCMotor_fichiers/motorParameters.png">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 3: Technical Parameters</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We make sure the motor operates in the temperature and with the
      supply voltage for which these values are valid. <br>
      The stiction torque is obtained from the no load current or from its
      explicit value given in the data sheet.<br>
      After setting the static parameters for the inertia and machine:
      It is important not to forget to set the initial value of the current to
      its stall value, so that no electrical transient phenomena occur at the
      start of the simulation. This value can be calculated from the stall
      torque (see below).      
    </p>

    <h2>
      <u>Simulation</u>
    </h2>
    <h3><a name="Input_to_system_chapter">
      <u>Input to system</u>
    </a></h3>
    <p>            
      The torque input is a ramp decreasing from its stall value to 0.
      The stall torque is set using the maximum value between the stall torque
      value from data sheet and the following formula: \(k \cdot \frac{U}{R}\), with k, the
      torque constant, U the supplied voltage and R the electrical resistance
      for the armature winding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once all parameters are correctly set, run the simulation for the torque
      evolution duration.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <u>Results</u>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The classical characteristic for DC motor can be plotted:

    <p>
      To select a DC motor from its characteristics, the usage of the machine
      must be known (intermittent or intensive usage). Indeed, optimizing the
      dynamic performances or the global efficiency influences the machine
      choice. The maximum torque can also be an important criterion. For
      intensive continuous usage it is recommended to select the motor so that
      the nominal point is between the maximum efficiency point and the maximum
      power point.
